# Documentation / Notes

General concept:

- Fixed mitigation pathway (1.5Â°, see IMP from Chapter 3 from AR6 WG3 report)
- Most relevant sectors are modelled as *actors* in the system
- *actors* emit, consume, and occupy resources, for example a forest needs space, takes CO2 from the atmosphere and emits biomass (wood)
- Actors can also be other mechanisms that "emit" money into the system, for example budget from the EU-ETS
- The user may influence some of these actors, e.g. by increasing the quantity factor of an actor; other actors follow fixed time-series
