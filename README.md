# CDR Simulator
The [Carbon Clock](https://www.mcc-berlin.net/en/research/co2-budget.html) is ticking!
With under a decade left to get to a carbon-neutral society to likely limit global warming to 1.5°C, 
we must not only push for mitigation (i.e. stop emitting greenhouse gases), but also remove CO2 from the atmosphere
that we've already emitted.
This is known as negative emission [technologies] (NET) or carbon dioxide removal (CDR).

This simulator mimics our socioeconomic system as represented by a fictional nation that is on an ambitious pathway to limit global warming.
They already have a fixed plan to reduce their annual emissions to zero by 2100 but need your help to meet net-zero targets
(there always remains some amount of hard-to-abate emissions) and lower the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere
by speeding up natural mechanisms of binding CO2 like planting trees, spreading rock dust, or fertilising oceans and
investing in novel CDR like direct air capture (DAC), biochar, or BECCS.

## Background
This project started with the goal to invite a wide audience to learn about negative emissions technologies in a playful manner.
Most notably, 
* we have to do more than just plant a few trees (afforestation/reforestation),
* we have to massively increase up growth of CDR deployment,
* we have to stop all emissions, carbon capture and storage (CCS) is *not* CDR,
* potential risks of CDR outweigh very certain risks of doing nothing.

At the current rate of emissions, we only have 6 years left on the carbon clock.
By that point, we will reach a CO2 concentration in the atmosphere to likely cross 1.5°C global warming.
Every tenth of a degree counts, so let's pull all stops to reduce emissions and historic emissions.

## Disclaimer
The facts, numbers, and events used in this simulator are purely fictional.
However, we aim to reflect effects as realistically as possible within the limits of a massively over-simplified complex system.
Although we try to provide references to scientific sources for all mechanisms, the claims made in this simulator do not necessarily reflect scientific consensus.
In particular, any opinions and decisions were made by individuals who authored this project, and in their capacity here do not represent their affiliation.
